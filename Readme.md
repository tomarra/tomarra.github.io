# TomArra.com

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomarra/tomarra.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomarra/tomarra.com)

The repo for my personal website. The site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is running a modified version of the [Slate theme](https://github.com/jasoncostello/slate).

## Development

- Install Jekyll and clone the repo
- From the command line run `jekyll serve` to start generate the files and start up the web server
- Pages are a mix of HTML and Markdown, all CSS should be done in Sass and compiled down to CSS by Jekyll

## Deployment
