Today I am launching a pretty big update to Bike Share Buddy, [version 1.3](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/bike-share-buddy/id998776734?mt=8).

> - Added support for over 450 new networks across 45 different countries
> - Bug fixes

Overall there's not much in UI changes here but the market expansion is huge. This update takes it from 6 networks across 2 countries to really being worldwide. This was done using an API from [CityBik.es](https://citybik.es/) which is free to use. It seems like they keep adding networks on their own so support for new networks should come for free when the source data changes. 

I am actually really happy with this update. Due to the way the application was written it was easy for me to change just the services and some slight changes to the models and the UI layer just worked. It really validated the choices I made when doing the initial design of the application.
