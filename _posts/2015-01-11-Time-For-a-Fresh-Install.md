_Side Note: I had this written up back in October and for some reason I didn’t hit the post button :/_

With the launch of OS X 10.10 Yosemite (man that’s a mouth full) I took it as a good time to do a fresh install on my MacBook Air. I have been running the Dev Preview builds since they were released and while everything has been running just fine I have noticed a few hiccups in the last couple weeks. With a fresh install I am able to only really put the bare essentials on and that’s what I have documented here.

<!--more-->

- Skype – Over the last couple years my work buddies and I have amassed quite a number of chat logs and now that we are all split up across other companies this is our main way of communication. How else are we supposed to send goofy links to everyone throughout the day?
- SourceTree – Yes I know “real” programmers use the command line but SourceTree just makes everything about Git easier. Plus with the integration it has with BitBucket my workflow is much easier.
- Xcode – I have been learning iOS programming for the last two months which you have to use Xcode for. I hated it at first but have grown to like a few things it does.
- 1Password – I have been a 1Password user for many years and the updates they have made, both on mobile and desktop, have been great. It’s quite the pricey application but I can’t imagine not using it.
- OneNote – Like I said before, a dead simple note taking app that works no matter what device I’m using.
- BetterTouchTool – I replaced Cinch with BTT due to a Microsoft mouse I was using. It allows me to do the window snapping that Cinch did plus more customization of my extra mouse buttons.
- Sublime Text 2 – I know a lot of Mac users end up using BBEdit but since I tend to switch back and forth between Mac and Windows a Sublime Text license was an easier price for me to pay.
- OneDrive – Being that I have Office 365 and it comes with 1TB of OneDrive storage it has become my default place to save stuff. Also automatic photo backup on any device is a huge selling point for me.
- Microsoft Office Suite – Yes it’s an old crusty application from 2011 but its needed to get work done so it’s part of the default install.
- Pixelmator – I bought a license for Pixelmator through the Mac App Store a while ago so I keep getting the updates for free and it has totally been worth it. I don’t want to pay monthly for a Photoshop license because I don’t use it enough but Pixelmator is powerful enough to get the job done for the few times a month I use it.
- Disk App – With my aging MacBook Air I only have a 256GB SSD so every gigabyte counts. This simple little app let’s me know where I have some big files that I may not need anymore and can quickly help delete them.
- Twitterrific – Run running in split screen having Twitterrific running on the side of one screens is a nice way of keeping up with things. The main reason for using this instead of the official Twitter app is integration with TweetMarker which keeps my timeline in sync between my phone (TweetBot) and laptop.
- Scroll Reverser – Like I said in my last post about Mac software this simple little utility keeps me sane by letting me have different scrolling directions based on the mouse type.
