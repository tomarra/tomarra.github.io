I decided to jump in with both feet on this one so let’s see how it goes.

**New Look** – The whole site is now run in WordPress. I know this seems like a cop-out being that I am an engineer but I figure this time around I would rather focus on the content of the site instead of trying to maintain something so let’s give this a shot.

**New Host** – I’m moving away from my old hosting (Dreamhost) not because it was bad but because I wanted something more flexible. So DNS work has gone to DNSimple and the hosting has moved over to Azure.

**New Content** – Let’s see if I can actually keep a commitment for once :)
