Time for another personal project plug. A update to Flashlight finally got approved and published to the Ovi Store. You can see the changes in my GitHub repo but the gist of it I added a power button and the ability to “dim” the screen. Unfortunately there is no way to do a straight update of the app on the phone so if it is installed you need to uninstall it and then re-download it from Ovi Store.

In less then a month in the Ovi Store Flashlight has over 29,000 downloads which really blows my mind considering that those downloads were based off of version 1.0.0 and there was almost no functionality there.
