Usually I don’t write about things like this but after seeing some horror stories on other sites I figured I would chime in.

Along with most of the Internet I watched the Apple keynote address announcing the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Not a lot in surprises being that most of it was leaked but it was presented in a nice, neat little demo package. Right away I said to myself, not going to preorder either of these. I needed to get them both in my hands in order to make an informed decision.

Preorder day comes and of course everything comes [crashing down](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/12/6139369/apple-iphone-6-pre-order-fail) while most people were fast asleep. Reports start coming out that supply is going to be limited so  lines start at Apple stores up to [1 week before](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/14964/20140905/photographic-evidence-iphone-lines-already-formed-apple-stores.htm) launch day. At this point I say screw it, Il just wait for the second batch of shipments after I play with it.

Now it’s launch day (as well as my [first day of unemployment](http://tomarra.com/2014/09/19/looking-back-at-novkiasoft/)) and around noon I decide to venture out to my local Best Buy. There was no way I was going to get close to an Apple Store today and I figured it would be an easy way to play around with the new hardware for a few minutes. I pull up, walk in and find no line. Anywhere. I see both new devices sitting on a display stand with no one near them. Weird.

After a few minutes of playing with the 6 and 6 Plus a Best Buy employee walks up to me seeing if I have any questions. On a whim I say “Do you have any new iPhone’s in stock?”. Without even thinking about it he said “Of course, what specific one were you looking for?”.

“6, 64GB, Space Grey, AT&T?”.

“Yep! One left.”

10 minutes later I walked out with a  brand new phone. I’m not saying that this was the experience for everyone going to a Best Buy around the country, in fact my local store didn’t get a single 6 Plus. But it was nice to go around the lines and still have an enjoyable experience when getting a new device.
