It didn’t take long. Time to shamelessly plug my own work.

Flashlight for S40 is built on the Nokia S40 Web App platform that runs on top of the Nokia Browser. While the “app” does nothing but cycle though some color’s on the screen it was the first time I posted anything to a mobile marketplace and that in itself was worth it. I plan on adding some features, some of which are already implemented and sitting my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tomarra/S40_Flashlight), and localizing the keywords in order to drive up downloads. Granted in only 10 days in the Ovi Store Flashlight has already cleared over 7,500 downloads. Not bad for and app that just cycles though 4 colors.
