I have never gone through the trouble of making this website use SSL even though I know it's the right thing to do. It's an extra expense and I didn't want to deal with setting it all up, renewals, etc. Lucky for me procrastination paid off.

GitHub has added support for [SSL with Custom Domains](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/)! All it took was a quick DNS change and ticking a checkbox and it was complete. On top of that there is an "Enforce HTTPS" option now as well which makes it even easier for end users.
