Flash. Just saying the word makes me cringe. It’s never ran well on my desktop or laptop let alone any tablet I have seen but the Internet just loves it. With an onslaught of new features in HTML5, and a lot of websites moving towards these features, we can only hope that Flash will have a funeral sooner rather than later.

The one reason most sites are still Flash based is because the web designers and developers really don’t want to go back and recode everything. Well now Google is stepping in to help the process out with [Google Swiffy](https://developers.google.com/swiffy). The idea is simple; Flash goes in, HTML5 comes out. Just like everything else coming from Google it’s in the Google Labs/Beta stage but I really hope this will catch on.
