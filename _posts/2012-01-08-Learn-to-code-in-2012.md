In this past year there have been a few great websites created to learn to write code. None have been as good as [Codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com/). While it only getâ€™s you started in programming logic it does it in a simple way that just about anybody can understand. And in order to get even more people excited about and learning about writing code they have started [Code Year](http://www.codeyear.com/).

The premise is simple. Every week a new programming lesson will be e-mailed to you and you have a week to complete it. By the end of the year you should have enough general programming knowledge to be able to pick up a book on a new language and hit the ground running. Over 200,000 people have already signed up and are ready to start learning, including myself. While I am already a professional software engineer it never hurts to keep learning, or at the very least keep practicing.
