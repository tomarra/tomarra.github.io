I’ve been trying to use Git more and more so GitHub is the obvious next step. On top of that today GitHub decided to release a native Mac OS application and a “Clone in Mac” button on their site when viewing a repo. I installed the free GitHub client and played around with it a bit and while its nice I don’t know if it’s enough to make me leave Tower.
