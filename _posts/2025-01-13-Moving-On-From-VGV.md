I originally [posted this on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7284698801167048705/) but wanted to save it here as well and have the ability to expand on it.

"While I‚Äôve had a great time the last 4 years, this will unfortunately be my last week with Very Good Ventures.

Getting to be a part of moving the Flutter community and ecosystem forward, while also working with clients around the globe to make their multi-platform development strategy work for teams of every size was thrilling. This multi-platform way of developing products is the bleeding edge, especially for big organizations, to ensure that they are taking care of customer needs and staying on top of their technology needs at the same time. Bringing my experience from Nokia, Microsoft, and BMW to VGV and building upon it for our clients and our own development was an invaluable experience, one I will look back on fondly on undoubtedly call upon in my journey forward.

But all good things end, and situations have dictated that the time is now. While I won‚Äôt mind taking a little time off, I know myself too well that I would like to get a fresh experience started soon. If you have a need for an Engineering focused & Product minded individual who enjoys working with high-performing teams at a small or global level, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out as I am now Open To Work."

I joined VGV when the world was still upside down but I knew I wanted to continue working in the Flutter ecosystem as I saw how it solved real problems for me as a Product Manager at BMW. I‚Äôm happy to say that my gut was correct and more and more companies are realizing it for themselves so learning how to be a consultant during the last 4 years has been incredibly rewarding.

I had the chance to not just work with clients all over the globe, but also help build and shape a company at the same time. When I joined VGV it was around 15 people, at the start of 2025 they are about to eclipse 150 worldwide. And that last word, worldwide, I think is the key. Given that we started to really grow VGV during the height of COVID, we had to go find the right people with the right skills, no matter where they were located across the world. It‚Äôs a great sales line, but it‚Äôs also true. That‚Äôs how VGV can keep their hold as the top Flutter consultancy and it shows. I enjoyed working with many VGV employees, or Unicorns, from several countries around the world which just lets you broaden your own frame of reference for the future. I hope others get the same experience in the future as it for sure has helped shaped the way I enjoy working and being part of an overall team.

So, what‚Äôs next? Honestly, not sure. While I have a few conversations in the works, I don‚Äôt think a brief break to start off the year would be a bad thing. I hope I can continue to be part of the Flutter ecosystem & community, as I still believe that it solves a lot of issues that companies and products face today. In the meantime, I won‚Äôt mind spending a bit more time training üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ and curling ü•å.
