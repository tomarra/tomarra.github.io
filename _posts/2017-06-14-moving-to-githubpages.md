Over the past few months I have used [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) more for [other](http://dollarsandsenseofwestworld.com) [projects](http://cloudgatestudios.com) and have been pretty impressed. The main reason I didnâ€™t use Pages for this site in the past was my reliance on plugins for Jekyll. Well I now come to find out that there is a whitelist for approved plugins that will run on Pages. Lucky for me everything I was using was already on the list :)

Long story short, I saved myself $5 a month and moved off of DigitalOcean and over to GitHub Pages.
