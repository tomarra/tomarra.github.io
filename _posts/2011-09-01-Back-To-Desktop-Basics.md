While I love taking pictures and using them as my desktop image sometimes it’s nice to have something a little more simple. That’s where [Simple Desktop’s](http://simpledesktops.com/) come in. It’s a great collection of simple yet fun desktop images that come in very high resolution images so you don’t have to worry about pixelation on your massive 27″ monitor.
