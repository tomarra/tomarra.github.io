A few days ago I [wrote](/2011/06/28/Just-What-We-Need-Another-Social-Network.html) about the new top bar on the Google sites which was white and turned to black. At the time this made no sense to me as the pages just looked goofy and the black bar was carried across all of their services except for Gmail. Well now that has changed. Google has begun to roll out UI changes to Gmail and Google Calendar to conform to the new UI. Overall the changes are a bit startling at first compared to what we have all come to expect from Google but I think in time this could be a good move. Now if they could just get the Android UI/UX to match up with Web UI/UX then they could have a golden platform.

Also I now have a Google+ account so after some use and helping populate the user base I hope to have a write up on it soon.
