Looks like Google is going to try it’s hand again at some kind of social network. The landing page for [Google+](http://plus.google.com/) has just surfaced and with that it seems as though Google is rolling out some possible rebranding.

Really Google? A black top bar? Doesn’t that go against your entire web UI?

**Update:** Look’s like Engadget got an invite to Google+ and has a writeup on it [here](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/google-invite-received-we-go-hands-on/). Looks like an good approach but only time will tell if they can top the giant that is Facebook.
